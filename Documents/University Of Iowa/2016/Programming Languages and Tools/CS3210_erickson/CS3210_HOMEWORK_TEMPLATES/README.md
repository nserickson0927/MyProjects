# CS3210_Homework_Templates

These files are provided as templates to start each homework for those who are not comfortable with writing a makefile or CMakeLists.txt file.

It is recommended to copy the folder for each homework into your UIowa github repository, and then open the CMakeLists.txt with kdevelop or CLion. 

If you're using another IDE you may need to generate the files for your specific IDE in a separate build directory. Make sure to update the files in your UIowa github repository as this may not be automated if your IDE does not support CMake directly like kdevelop and CLion do.

See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html for details on how to generate files for various IDEs.
